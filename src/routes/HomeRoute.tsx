Using artifical intelligence, it also offers an automated categorisation for specific production and decay modes of the Higgs boson. The corresponding database is updated daily."
          // text="The Higgs boson, named after the the physicist Peter Higgs is a subatomic particle. It is the manifestation of the Higgs field, a quantum field that is present everywhere throughout the Universe. Certain particles interact with the Higgs field field via the Higgs mechanism and as a result obtain mass. The Higgs boson is the result of an excitation in this field."
