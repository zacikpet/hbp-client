          text="The Higgs boson, named after the the physicist Peter Higgs is a subatomic particle. It is the manifestation of the Higgs field, a quantum field that is present everywhere throughout the Universe.
        Certain particles interact with the Higgs field field via the Higgs mechanism and as a result obtain mass. The Higgs boson is the result of an excitation in this field."
